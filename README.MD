# Crypto trading robot

## Background 

This robot was created to help me to exit positions (trailing stops) better, to buy at more appropriate points then 'right now', and also to execute stop losses thoroughly. Out of curiousity, I have also created an integration with Telegram and implemented time analysis to predict price moves. 

The following folders are in the project: 
- 'exchanges' includes libraries to work with crypto exchanges
- 'price_log' is a location of prices generated by price_logger.py
- 'system_msg' currently includes system log generated by the telegram monitoring script telegramlib.py
- 'logs_buy' and 'logs_trade' include trading logs generated by loglib.py

The following scripts are used: 
- exchange_func.py includes wrappers for functions of specific exchanges (from the 'exchange' folder) so that the data has the same format to be processed by the other script. Note that your API keys for exchanges should be specified there. 
- loglib.py is a library with a few logging functions 
- platformlib.py is a library to detect your OS and return proper folders to launch additional scripts
- price_logger.py gets price ticker from exchanges and saves data in price_log folder 
- robot.py is the main script which performs the monitoring of position prices and sells or buys back
- smart_buy.py is the script used to buy positions immediately or on specific events 
- sqltools.py is used for working with workflow.db sqlite database
- tdlib.py is used to analyse the price data and return values of time analysis indicators
- telegramlib.py works with telegram messages. Note that you would need to register a telegram bot and configure your tokens / chat id in this script. 

## How to set things up 

After registering your API keys on exchanges, you would need to specify them in exchange_func.py. Also, if you want to use Telegram functionality, create a bot (via botfather), and configure your tokens and chat id in the telegramlib.py. 

I would recommend setting up a virtual machine or using a cloud VM so that popping screens do not disctract you at your usual working environment. You would need to launch daemon.py (for processing your telegram messages) and price_logger.py (for price updates feeding to tdlib). Please check daemon.py code for available commands and modes. Eventually, you would have an environment like this:

## Terms of use and non-responsibility clause

Please use the scripts at your own risk. I am not responsible for your API keys being lost or intercepted, as well as your funds lost as a consequence of using the scripts. These scripts have some fool protection included - however, you are fully responsible for secure storage of the scripts and for your course of actions. 

## Contributions 

As there are many other exchanges out there except for bittrex, I would appreciate anyone's help in including other exchange APIs and writing a wrapper in exchange_func.py (binance being the main priority currently). Additionally, I would appreciate help in more thorough processing of price/time data and developing a predictive model using sklearn. This would require getting historical data, for example, from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data), using tdlib for the calculation of parameters, and then training a model based on the data. An example of how this could be done is available at my [Enron project repository](https://github.com/illi4/Enron_fraud). 

Please feel free to contribute on github directly or contact me first via Telegram (illi4).

## Donations

Donations would be much appreciated so that I can spend more time on coding and research.
